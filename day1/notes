# Introduction to Javascript

Developer know html and CSS, why do we need javascript

1: We can’t put C++ in the browser , it’s too heavy, unsafe, and inaccessible. Our users are not
kernel developers; they’re web authors who just learned `<table>` and `<font>`. We need
something lightweight, interpreted, forgiving, and safe.

2: **Massive Security Nightmare:**

- **Unrestricted Access:** C++ gives you low-level control over memory and system calls. If a browser ran arbitrary C++ code from a website, that code could easily:
    - Read/write any file on your computer.
    - Install malware.
    - Access your webcam or microphone without permission.
    - Crash your entire operating system.
